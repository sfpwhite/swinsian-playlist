# swinsian-playlist
Convert Swinsian playlists to CUE format and csv.

I needed this for uploading playlists to mixcloud, but since I switched to Linux I don't use Swinsian anymore. I had planned to add more features, like converting to other formats and generating statistics about track frequency in my playlists, which would be interesting to me as a dj. Obviously, that never happened before I switched to Linux.

Maybe someone else might find this little bit interesting or useful, so here it is.
